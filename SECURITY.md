# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers with:
- A clear description of the issue
- Affected package(s) and version/commit
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Disclosure Process

After receiving a report, maintainers will:
1. Acknowledge receipt.
2. Validate and assess impact.
3. Prepare and test a fix.
4. Coordinate disclosure timing.

## Scope

Security reports are especially relevant for:
- Asset/mod loading and filesystem path handling
- Plugin/module loading boundaries
- Serialization/deserialization logic
- Platform bridge integrations

## Safe Harbor

We appreciate good-faith security research intended to improve project safety. Please avoid actions that could harm users, data, or service availability.
